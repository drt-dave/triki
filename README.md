# Tic tac toe React project 
 "This Tic Tac Toe project was developed following the React tutorial. The tutorial provided me with a solid foundation in understanding the fundamental concepts of React, such as state manipulation and events. From there, I customized and added my own unique ideas and features to create a fun and challenging game experience for users. Through this project, I was able to improve my understanding of React and acquire valuable skills in developing interactive web applications."
